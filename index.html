                    I am a first-year PhD student in Government and Social Policy, and a Graduate Fellow with the Center for American Political Studies. My research on race and ethnic politics in the U.S. focuses on intergroup contact, inequality, and education policy. I hold a BA in Political Science and Philosophy from Columbia University, and have completed a year of study in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Oxford.

                From Columbia University, I received a Human Rights Research Fellowship to study alternative peacebuilding practices in Civil Wars across the globe with Séverine Autesserre, contributing to the book project, <em>The Frontlines of Peace</em> (Oxford University Press, 2021). I also received a Laidlaw Research Fellowship to study undocumented immigration in the United States.
